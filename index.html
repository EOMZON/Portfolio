        When I left the east coast to work in the venture capital industry, I
        was struck by a number of realizations—east and west coast designers
        were doing such different things, and the tech industry had changed
        drastically while I’d been busy in academia. But the biggest surprise of
        all was how disconnected the tech industry had become from the humanity
        that gave birth to it all. I’ve been lucky enough to have had access to
        a computer for forty years, and I’ve always fought to give the arts a
        first-class role in its evolution. Yet I found few humanist
        technologists working in Silicon Valley. Erika Hall was the exception.
        Erika represented a point of view that was grounded in not just what the
        technology could do, but—more importantly—in what real humans needed to
        do. She was challenging the comfortable models of tech’s “best
        practices,” like ubiquitously produced “personas”—artifacts that gave
        the appearance of serving users, without necessarily teaching designers
        how to listen to them. I like to tell designers that their job isn’t to
        be storytellers, but to be story-listeners—people who takes the time and
        energy to listen to others’ stories. That’s the essence of a
        conversation: people listening to each other. And a conversational
        design approach can help designers serve people better. “Conversational
        design is truly human-centered design,” Erika writes, and let me tell
        you why that resonates with me. She focuses on what designers really
        need to know, including the idea that there is no simple solution when
        it comes to designing for humans. At the core of Erika’s quixotic work
        is an effort to ground the designer’s aspirational goal of empathy in
        reality. Real people. Real feelings. Real conversations. And above all:
        real listening. When designed well, conversational interfaces are able
        to amplify the human-computer bond—and create a relationship grounded in
        communication. When they work poorly, they produce mistrust. When they
        work effectively, they promote trust. Trust lies at the heart of great
        design. And trust begins with listening
